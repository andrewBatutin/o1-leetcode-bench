To solve the problem, we need to simulate the game between Alice and Bob on a 50x50 chessboard where a knight captures pawns. The goal is to maximize the total number of moves made by both players until all pawns are captured, with Alice trying to maximize and Bob trying to minimize this total.

Here's a step-by-step strategy to solve the problem:

1. **Precompute Minimum Moves**:
    - First, calculate the minimum number of moves the knight requires to reach any pawn from any other pawn or from the starting position. This is done using Breadth-First Search (BFS).
    - We precompute these distances and store them in a matrix to avoid recalculating them multiple times during the game simulation.

2. **Game Simulation with Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
    - Use Dynamic Programming with memoization to simulate the game.
    - The state of the game can be represented by the current position of the knight and the set of remaining pawns (using a bitmask).
    - Depending on whose turn it is (Alice's or Bob's), the player will choose a pawn to capture that either maximizes or minimizes the total number of moves.
    - Memoization helps in storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations, making the solution efficient even for larger inputs.

3. **Handling Player Turns**:
    - Determine whose turn it is based on the number of pawns already captured. If an even number of pawns have been captured, it's Alice's turn; otherwise, it's Bob's turn.

4. **Edge Cases**:
    - Ensure that all edge cases are handled, such as when there is only one pawn or when the knight is already on a pawn's position.

Here's the Python implementation of the solution:

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Precomputing Minimum Moves**:
    - We define all positions, including the starting position of the knight and the positions of all pawns.
    - For each position, we perform BFS to compute the minimum number of moves required to reach every other position. These distances are stored in the `min_moves` matrix.

2. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**:
    - The `dp` function takes the current position index and a bitmask representing the remaining pawns.
    - It determines whose turn it is based on the number of pawns already captured.
    - If it's Alice's turn, she selects the pawn that maximizes the total number of moves. If it's Bob's turn, he selects the pawn that minimizes the total number of moves.
    - The function uses memoization (`@lru_cache`) to store and reuse results of subproblems, making the solution efficient.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
    - The code handles cases where there might be unreachable pawns by skipping them.
    - If no pawns are left, the function returns 0, as no more moves can be made.

### Testing the Solution:

Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
    - **Input**: `kx = 1, ky = 1, positions = [[0,0]]`
    - **Output**: `4`
    - **Explanation**: The knight takes 4 moves to reach the pawn at (0,0).

2. **Example 2**:
    - **Input**: `kx = 0, ky = 2, positions = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]`
    - **Output**: `8`
    - **Explanation**: Alice and Bob alternate choosing pawns to maximize and minimize the total number of moves, resulting in a total of 8 moves.

3. **Example 3**:
    - **Input**: `kx = 0, ky = 0, positions = [[1,2],[2,4]]`
    - **Output**: `3`
    - **Explanation**: Regardless of the order in which Alice and Bob choose the pawns, the total number of moves will be 3.

The implemented solution correctly handles these cases and efficiently computes the maximum total number of moves.
