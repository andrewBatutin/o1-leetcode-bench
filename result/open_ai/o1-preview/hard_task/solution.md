To solve this problem, we'll employ a minimax strategy with memoization to ensure efficiency. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Positions Indexing**: We create a list `positions_num` where the initial knight's position is at index `0`, and the pawn positions are at indexes `1` to `N`.

2. **Distance Precomputation**:
   - Since the knight's moves are restricted, we precompute the minimal distances (number of moves) between all pairs in `positions_num` using BFS.
   - Precomputing distances reduces redundant calculations during the recursive search.

3. **Memoization**:
   - We use a dictionary `memo` to store the results of subproblems.
   - The key for memoization is a tuple `(k_pos_index, pawns_mask, turn)`.
     - `k_pos_index`: Current position index of the knight.
     - `pawns_mask`: A bitmask representing the remaining pawns.
     - `turn`: Indicates whose turn it is (0 for Alice, 1 for Bob).

4. **Minimax DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function recursively explores all possible moves.
   - **Alice's Turn (`turn == 0`)**:
     - She tries to maximize the total number of moves.
     - For each remaining pawn, she calculates the total moves if she captures that pawn next.
     - She selects the move that results in the maximum total moves.
   - **Bob's Turn (`turn == 1`)**:
     - He tries to minimize the total number of moves.
     - Similarly, he considers each pawn and selects the one leading to the minimum total moves.
   - The function returns the maximum (or minimum) total moves depending on whose turn it is.

5. **Bitmask Representation**:
   - We use a bitmask to efficiently represent and manipulate the set of remaining pawns.
   - This reduces the state space and allows for efficient memoization.

6. **Knight's Possible Positions**:
   - The knight's positions are limited to the initial position and the positions of the pawns (after capturing them).
   - This significantly reduces the number of knight positions we need to consider.
