To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize the convex hull trick to optimize the dynamic programming approach.

**Dynamic Programming Relation:**

We are asked to find the maximum total score to reach index `i`. The score for a jump from index `k` to index `i` is:
\[ \text{score} = \text{dp}[k] + (\text{nums}[k]) \times (i - k) \]
This can be rearranged to:
\[ \text{dp}[i] = \max_{k < i} \left( \text{dp}[k] - (\text{nums}[k] \times k) + \text{nums}[k] \times i \right) \]
This is akin to finding the maximum value of lines of the form:
\[ y = m_k \times x + c_k \]
where:
- \( m_k = \text{nums}[k] \)
- \( c_k = \text{dp}[k] - \text{nums}[k] \times k \)

At each position `i` (or `x`), we need to find the line that gives us the maximum `y` value.

**Convex Hull Trick Implementation:**

Since we process `x` in increasing order (from `0` to `n-1`), we can maintain a convex hull of lines and efficiently query the maximum `y` for each `x`. The challenge is handling arbitrary slopes (`nums[k]`), which may not be sorted.

Here's how we can implement it:

1. **Maintain a deque of lines:** Each line is represented by its slope (`m`) and intercept (`c`).
2. **Adding new lines:** When we add a new line, we remove lines from the back of the deque if they are no longer needed (i.e., if the new line makes them obsolete for future queries).
3. **Querying the maximum `y`:** Since `x` increases, we can move a pointer to find the best line for the current `x` efficiently.

**Avoiding Floating Point Precision:**

To avoid floating-point precision issues when calculating intersections, we can compare the cross-product of lines to determine if a line should be removed from the convex hull.

Here's the Python code implementing the above approach:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findMaximumScore(self, nums):
        from collections import deque
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [0] * n
        # Convex hull deque, storing lines as (m, c)
        # Lines are added in order, and queries are made for increasing x
        hull = deque()
        
        # Initialize with dp[0], line y = m * x + c
        dp[0] = 0
        hull.append((nums[0], dp[0] - nums[0] * 0))
        pointer = 0  # Pointer for the hull

        for i in range(1, n):
            # Query hull to find maximum dp[i]
            x = i
            # Move pointer forward if next line gives better value
            while pointer + 1 < len(hull) and \
                  hull[pointer + 1][0] * x + hull[pointer + 1][1] >= \
                  hull[pointer][0] * x + hull[pointer][1]:
                pointer += 1

            dp[i] = hull[pointer][0] * x + hull[pointer][1]

            # Prepare new line to add to hull
            # Line: y = m * x + c
            m = nums[i]
            c = dp[i] - nums[i] * i
            new_line = (m, c)

            # Remove lines that are no longer needed
            while len(hull) >= 2 and self.is_bad(hull[-2], hull[-1], new_line):
                hull.pop()
                pointer = min(pointer, len(hull) - 1)
            hull.append(new_line)
        return dp[n - 1]

    def is_bad(self, line1, line2, line3):
        # Check if line2 is unnecessary
        # Returns True if line2 is worse than line3 for some x
        # We compare the intersection points of line1 & line2 and line1 & line3
        # To avoid floating point, we cross-multiply
        m1, c1 = line1
        m2, c2 = line2
        m3, c3 = line3
        # (c2 - c1) / (m1 - m2) >= (c3 - c1) / (m1 - m3)
        return (c3 - c1) * (m1 - m2) <= (c2 - c1) * (m1 - m3)
```
