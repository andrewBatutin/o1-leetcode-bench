To solve the problem of maximizing the number of moves made by Alice and Bob while capturing pawns on a chessboard, we can use a recursive approach with memoization. The key idea is to simulate the game where Alice tries to maximize the total moves while Bob tries to minimize them.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Knight's Moves**: Define the possible moves of a knight in chess. The knight can move in an "L" shape, which gives it 8 possible positions to move to.

2. **Distance Calculation**: Create a function to calculate the minimum number of moves required for the knight to reach a specific pawn using Breadth-First Search (BFS). This will help us determine how many moves it takes for Alice or Bob to capture a pawn.

3. **Game Simulation**: Use a recursive function to simulate the game. The function will take the current position of the knight, the remaining pawns, and the turn (whether it's Alice's or Bob's). Depending on whose turn it is, the function will either maximize or minimize the total moves.

4. **Memoization**: Store results of previously computed states to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.

5. **Base Case**: If there are no pawns left, return 0 since no more moves can be made.

Here is the complete Python solution implementing the above logic:

```python
from collections import deque
from functools import lru_cache

class Solution(object):
    def maxMoves(self, kx, ky, positions):
        """
        :type kx: int
        :type ky: int
        :type positions: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """

        knight_moves = [
            (2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1),
            (1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)
        ]

            if start == target:

            visited.add(start)
            moves = 0

                        if 0 <= nx < 50 and 0 <= ny < 50 and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                            if (nx, ny) == target:
                                return moves + 1
                            visited.add((nx, ny))
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                moves += 1

        distances = []
        for pos in positions:
            distances.append(min_moves((kx, ky), tuple(pos)))
        
        # Memoization for the recursive function
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(remaining_mask):
            remaining_positions = [positions[i] for i in range(len(positions)) if (remaining_mask & (1 << i)) != 0]
            if not remaining_positions:
                return 0

            for i in range(len(remaining_positions)):
                pawn_distance = distances[i]
                new_mask = remaining_mask & ~(1 << i)  # Remove the pawn from the mask
                # Calculate moves if Alice captures this pawn
                moves = pawn_distance + dfs(new_mask)
                max_moves = max(max_moves, moves)

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
print(solution.maxMoves(1, 1, [[0, 0]]))  # Output: 4
print(solution.maxMoves(0, 2, [[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]]))  # Output: 8
print(solution.maxMoves(0, 0, [[1, 2], [2, 4]]))  # Output: 3

### Explanation of the Code:
- The `min_moves` function calculates the minimum moves required for the knight to reach a specific pawn using BFS.
- The `dfs` function recursively explores all possible moves, keeping track of which pawns are still available using a bitmask.
- The `lru_cache` decorator is used to memoize results of the `dfs` function to optimize performance.
- Finally, the solution is tested with the provided examples.
