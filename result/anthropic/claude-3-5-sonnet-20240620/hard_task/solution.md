Here's a Python solution to the given LeetCode problem:

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def maxMoves(self, kx, ky, positions):
        def bfs(start_x, start_y):
            queue = deque([(start_x, start_y, 0)])
            visited = set()
            distances = {}
            
            while queue:
                x, y, dist = queue.popleft()
                if (x, y) in visited:
                    continue
                visited.add((x, y))
                
                if [x, y] in positions:
                    distances[(x, y)] = dist
                
                for dx, dy in [(-2,-1),(-2,1),(-1,-2),(-1,2),(1,-2),(1,2),(2,-1),(2,1)]:
                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                    if 0 <= nx < 50 and 0 <= ny < 50:
                        queue.append((nx, ny, dist + 1))
            
            return distances
        
        distances = bfs(kx, ky)
        positions = [tuple(p) for p in positions]
        n = len(positions)
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(mask):
            if mask == (1 << n) - 1:
                return 0
            
            max_score = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if mask & (1 << i) == 0:
                    if positions[i] not in distances:
                        return float('-inf')
                    score = distances[positions[i]] + dfs(mask | (1 << i))
                    max_score = max(max_score, score)
            
            return max_score
        
        result = dfs(0)
        return result if result != float('-inf') else -1

```

This solution uses a combination of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Dynamic Programming (DP) with bitmasks. Here's how it works:

1. We first use BFS to calculate the distances from the knight's initial position to all possible pawn positions on the board. This is done in the `bfs` function.

2. We then use a DP approach with bitmasks to calculate the maximum total number of moves. The state of the DP is represented by a bitmask, where each bit represents whether a pawn has been captured or not.

3. The `dfs` function is our DP function. It takes a bitmask as input and returns the maximum number of moves possible from that state.

4. In the `dfs` function, we try capturing each uncaptured pawn and recursively calculate the score for the resulting state. We take the maximum of all these scores.

5. We use `@lru_cache(None)` for memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

6. If at any point we find a pawn that can't be reached (not in our distances dictionary), we return negative infinity to indicate an invalid state.

7. Finally, we return the result of `dfs(0)` (starting with no pawns captured), or -1 if the result is negative infinity (indicating an impossible scenario).

This solution should handle all the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description. The time complexity is O(2^n * n), where n is the number of pawns, due to the DP with bitmasks. The space complexity is O(2^n) for the memoization cache.
